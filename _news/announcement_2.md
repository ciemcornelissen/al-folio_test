Excited to share insights from our research on illumination-invariant hyperspectral imaging at the FAIR Day 2025! 

The talk covered the challenges of deploying AI in real-world agricultural settings and how our LISA framework overcomes lighting variability. Video recording will be available on YouTube soon.

**Key Topics:**
- Domain-adversarial learning for light-invariant features
- Real-time robotic systems for precision agriculture  
- End-to-end IoT integration for field deployment
- Future directions in hyperspectral AI research

Stay tuned for the YouTube link!
