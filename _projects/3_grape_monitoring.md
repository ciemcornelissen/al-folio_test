## Complete IoT-Enabled Robotic Grape Monitoring System

A fully integrated hardware-software system for autonomous, non-destructive grape quality assessment in operational vineyards.

### System Overview

This project represents the complete realization of precision viticulture technology - from custom sensor design to deployment-ready robotics. The system autonomously collects hyperspectral data, processes it in real-time, and generates spatially-resolved quality maps.

### Hardware Components

**Custom Hyperspectral Sensor**
- Push-broom imaging spectrometer
- 224 spectral bands (400-1000nm)
- Synchronized with robotic motion for geometric accuracy

**Mobile Robot Platform**
- Vineyard-traversable chassis
- GPS/RTK positioning for geo-registration
- Onboard computing for real-time processing

**IoT Communication Layer**
- Edge processing with cloud synchronization
- Real-time data streaming and visualization
- Multi-robot coordination capability

### Software Stack

**Perception Pipeline**
- OHSLIC for online phenotype segmentation
- LISA for illumination-invariant quality prediction
- Calibration and geometric correction modules

**Mapping & Analytics**
- Spatial interpolation for continuous quality maps
- Temporal tracking for within-season monitoring
- Decision support interface for vineyard managers

### Field Deployment

The system has been deployed across multiple commercial vineyards:
- **Autonomous operation**: Multi-hour missions without human intervention
- **High-throughput**: Process entire vineyard blocks in single sessions
- **Accuracy**: Brix prediction RÂ² > 0.85 under field conditions
- **Actionable insights**: Quality maps used for selective harvesting decisions

### Innovation

This project bridges the gap between laboratory spectroscopy and operational agriculture. Key innovations include:
- **Robustness**: Handles real-world variability (lighting, occlusion, wind)
- **Scalability**: System design allows fleet deployment
- **Usability**: Farm-ready interface for non-technical operators

### Impact

This complete system demonstrates that AI-driven precision agriculture is ready for commercial deployment, moving beyond proof-of-concept to solve real operational challenges in viticulture.
