I am a researcher at [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en), Department of Information Technology at Ghent University - imec, where I focus on developing AI-driven solutions for precision agriculture and environmental monitoring. My work bridges the gap between fundamental machine learning research and real-world applications in challenging, uncontrolled environments.

My research centers on the synergistic combination of **Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI)**, **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**, and **Deep Learning**. I develop end-to-end systems that transform raw sensor data from robotic platforms into actionable insights for agriculture and forestry. A key focus of my work is making these AI systems practical and deployable in the fieldâ€”addressing challenges like variable lighting conditions, limited computational resources on edge devices, and the need for real-time processing.

I hold a Master of Physics degree from Ghent University (2022), where my thesis explored criticality and forecasting in cryptocurrency markets. This background in complex systems and signal processing from noisy, high-dimensional data continues to inform my current research in remote sensing and machine vision.

**Research Highlights:**
- Developed **LISA** (Light-Invariant Spectral Autoencoder), a domain-adversarial deep learning framework for robust grape quality assessment under varying illumination conditions
- Created **OHSLIC** (Online Hyperspectral Simple Linear Iterative Clustering), an adaptive algorithm enabling efficient on-device phenotype segmentation on resource-constrained UAVs
- Pioneered research on computational fairness in adaptive neural networks, introducing resource allocation as a new dimension of algorithmic fairness

My work has been published in leading venues including the IEEE Internet of Things Journal, IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), and Neural Computing and Applications.

I am particularly interested in adaptive computation, domain-invariant learning, and the ethical implications of efficiency-driven AI systems. My research philosophy centers on identifying real-world deployment barriers and developing bespoke AI solutions to overcome them.
